# InsightIQ-Analytics-Platform-AWS-EC2-Deployment
InsightIQ Analytics is a modern, responsive analytics platform website built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates deploying a web application on AWS EC2 Free Tier using Apache Web Server, showcasing cloud hosting, Linux server management, and web development skills.


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Amazon EC2 (AWS Free Tier) ‚Äì Cloud compute instance for hosting
Amazon Linux 2 ‚Äì Operating system for the instance
Apache HTTP Server ‚Äì Web server for serving static content
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ‚Äì Frontend website technologies
SSH ‚Äì Secure connection to EC2 instance

üìã Steps to Deploy the Website
1. Launch EC2 Instance

Log in to AWS Management Console.
Navigate to EC2 service and launch a new instance.
Choose Amazon Linux 2 AMI (Free Tier eligible).
Select t2.micro instance type.
Configure security group to allow:
SSH (port 22) from your IP
HTTP (port 80) from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
Launch instance with a new or existing key pair.

2. Connect to EC2 via SSH

bash
ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem ec2-user@<EC2-Public-IP>
(Replace /path/to/your-key.pem and <EC2-Public-IP> with your actual key and instance IP).

3. Install Apache Web Server

bash
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum install httpd -y
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

4. Deploy the Website

Copy your single-file website (e.g., index.html) to the Apache web root:

bash
sudo mv index.html /var/www/html/
Set permissions if needed:

bash
sudo chmod 644 /var/www/html/index.html

5. Test Your Deployment

Open a browser and navigate to http://<EC2-Public-IP> to view your website.

üìà Key Features
